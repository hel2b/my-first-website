<h1>Web이란 무엇인가?</h1>
The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web,
a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages
that can be accessed by a Web browser.

<br>Many people assume that the Web is
the same as the Internet,
and use these terms interchangeably.
However, the term Internet actually refers
to the global network of servers that makes
the information sharing that happens over the Web
possible. So, although the Web does make up a
large portion of the Internet,
but they are not one and same.</p>
